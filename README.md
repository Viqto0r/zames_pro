# zames_pro

A terminal coding agent that works on top of [chat.deepseek.com](https://chat.deepseek.com/) through Playwright.
In spirit it is similar to Claude Code / Codex CLI: it starts in the current
directory, reads and edits files, runs commands, and commits to git.

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 18
- A DeepSeek account (you log in manually in the browser window that opens on first launch)

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g zames_pro
```

Chromium for Playwright is downloaded automatically on install. On Linux/WSL
the required system libraries are installed too when passwordless `sudo` is
available; otherwise run once by hand:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
sudo npx playwright install-deps chromium
```

## Usage

Go to your project folder and run:

```bash
zames
```

The agent works inside the directory it was started in and cannot leave it (sandbox).

While the agent is working you can keep typing: press Enter to queue a message
(it is sent right after the current task, in the same chat), or Esc / Ctrl+C to
abort the current generation. This mirrors typing during generation on the
DeepSeek website.

### Options

```
zames --task <task text>
zames --chat <id>
zames --new-chat
zames --resend-prompt
zames --dir <path>
zames --headless
zames --debug
zames --version
zames --help
```

## Configuration

Global config: `~/.zames/config.json`
Local (per project): `.zamesrc.json`

You can view and change settings without leaving the agent — use the
`/config` command. Run it without arguments to open an interactive menu
(↑/↓ to move, Enter to change, `d` to reset, `q` to quit). Booleans and enums
toggle in place; numbers and strings open an input prompt.

```
/config                       interactive settings menu
/config list                  print all editable settings
/config get <path>            show a setting
/config set <path> <value>    change a setting
/config reset <path>          reset a setting to its default
/config path                  show config file paths
/config lang <ru|en>          switch interface and agent language
```

Examples:

```
/config set maxIterations 20
/config set confirmation.bash false
/config lang en
```

Changes are written to the project `.zamesrc.json` and applied right away
(where possible without a restart).

### Language

`/config lang ru` or `/config lang en` switches both the interface language
(help, messages, spinner) and the language the agent answers you in. The
locale lives in `ui.locale` in the config file.

Agent data is stored in `~/.zames`: browser profile, logs, undo history, self-review snapshots.
